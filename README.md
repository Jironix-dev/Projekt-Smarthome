We did this Project in School.
This was supposed to be a Smart-Home Control, we did it this way:
- You have 2 different hand gestures to Login to the App
- If you Login you get to the floorplan of the House.
- Your Index Finger and your Thumb form the controls, the Cursor is the Tip of the Thumb and if you want to "click" something you pinch your Indexfinger and your TThumb together
- You can hover over the Rooms with the Cursor, they will light up, then you can click it.
- If you go into a room, you have a control for the lights and the blinds, both can be set to a value between 0 and 100%
- If you are in a Room you can go back if you click the "Zurück" Button in the top left corner.
- If you are on the Floorplan you can chose to open the menu in the top left corner, there you have 2 different options:
    - Close the Program, this has to be clicked twice so you dont press it by mistake
    - Logout, if you click this you have to take your hand out of the picture, after a few seconds you get to the login screen again and can login again.
